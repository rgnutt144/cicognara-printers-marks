# About this collection

This website is a project to help learn about CollectionBuilder, Github, and other tools used in digital scholarship. The collection on the site is a sample of the printing devices present within the Biblioteca Cicognara at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana. All devices have been reproduced from microfiche.
